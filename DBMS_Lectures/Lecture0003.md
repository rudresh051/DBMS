# Designing Databases

## Data Models
A collection of conceptual tools for describing data, data relationships, data semantics, and consistency constraints

1. The Entity-Relationship Model(E-R Model)
2. Relational Model

## The Entity-Relationship(E-R) Model
The entity-relationship (E-R) data model consists of a collection of basic objects, called entities, and of relationships among these objects.

## Relational Model
The relational model uses a collection of tables to represent both data and the relationships among those data

## Database Design
1. Requirement Analysis
2. Conceptual Database Design(E-R Modeling)
3. Schema Refinement
4. Logical Database Design(Relational Modeling/DB Tool used)
5. Physical Database Design => Decide the data structures to store db, Indexing
6. Security Design(Who can view, which users can see, what values to access)

## Standard Database Design
1. E-R Diagram
2. Relational Database Tables
